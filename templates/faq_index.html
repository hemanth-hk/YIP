				  <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">picture_in_picture</i>Can mental illness be prevented in children?</div>
				  <div class="collapsible-body">
				  <p>Most mental illnesses are caused by a combination of factors and hence cannot  really be prevented completely. One of the ways is to provide a secure and loving environment and  look out for possible signs of mental distress among your children. However, if symptoms are recognized and treatment  is started early, many of the distressing and disabling effects of a mental illness may be prevented or at least minimized. When treated appropriately and early, many children can fully recover from their mental illness   or successfully control their symptoms.  While some children  become disabled adults because of  a chronic or severe disorder, many people who have a mental illness are able to live full and productive lives. It is very important to seek treatment for your child if they are displaying any symptoms of mental illness. Without treatment, many mental disorders can continue into adulthood and lead to problems in all areas of the person's adult life. People with untreated mental disorders  are  at   high   risk  for many problems, including alcohol or drug abuse, and violent or self destructive behaviour, even suicide.
